Certainly! The code snippet you provided is a complex example of integrating quantum computing with a language model for emotion detection. Modifying it for quantum storage would require a different approach, as quantum storage is about encoding and retrieving data using quantum states.

Below, I'll outline a class that represents a simple Quantum Storage System. This class will allow you to encode data into a quantum state and then retrieve it. Please note that this is a highly abstract and simplified example, as true quantum storage would require a more complex physical implementation.

```python
import pennylane as qml
import numpy as np

class QuantumStorageSystem:
    def __init__(self, num_qubits):
        self.num_qubits = num_qubits
        self.dev = qml.device('default.qubit', wires=self.num_qubits)

    def encode_data(self, data):
        # Normalize the data to be in the range [0, pi]
        normalized_data = np.pi * np.array(data) / max(data)

        @qml.qnode(self.dev)
        def circuit(params):
            # Apply rotations to encode the data
            for i in range(self.num_qubits):
                qml.RY(params[i], wires=i)
            return qml.state()

        # Execute the circuit to encode the data
        encoded_state = circuit(normalized_data)
        return encoded_state

    def retrieve_data(self, encoded_state):
        # Define a circuit to measure the state
        @qml.qnode(self.dev)
        def circuit():
            # Prepare the encoded state
            qml.QubitStateVector(encoded_state, wires=range(self.num_qubits))
            # Measure the rotations
            return [qml.expval(qml.PauliY(wires=i)) for i in range(self.num_qubits)]

        # Execute the circuit to retrieve the data
        retrieved_data = circuit()
        # Scale the data back to its original range
        retrieved_data = retrieved_data * max(data) / np.pi
        return retrieved_data

# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_qubits = 4
    data_to_store = [0.5, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3]

    quantum_storage = QuantumStorageSystem(num_qubits)
    encoded_state = quantum_storage.encode_data(data_to_store)
    retrieved_data = quantum_storage.retrieve_data(encoded_state)

    print("Original Data:", data_to_store)
    print("Retrieved Data:", retrieved_data)
```

This code defines a simple quantum storage system that encodes data into a quantum state using rotations and then retrieves it by measuring those rotations. It's important to note that this is a highly idealized and simplified model. Real quantum storage would require a more complex encoding scheme, error correction, and a physical system capable of maintaining quantum coherence.
